# 2020 Report: Trends in the usage and purchase intentions of smartphones
The smartphone penetration has increased worldwide in the recent years. From 2012 to 2017, the user base increased from 1.04 to 2.09 billion, and it is forecasted to reach 3.8 billion users by 2021 (Statista, 2019). As more consumers are embracing mobile phones, manufacturers need to remain competitive to attract more consumers and convince existing users to upgrade their smartphones. Thus, it is important to understand the evolving consumer needs and preferences towards the usage of smartphones. In this report, results are presented from the survey, “Use, perception, and buying behavior of smartphones” which was administered by Coursera to online students from different parts of the world.
